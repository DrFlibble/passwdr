passwdr
=======

This is a simple tool that generates passwords based upon hashing a domain
name and a user given password. This means a single password can be used
to generate unique passwords for all of the sites you use.

This of course means that a single password could potentially be used to
gain passwords for all of your sites, so make sure you use a password that isn't
ever used elsewhere.
